# lfs-fake-course-eval-data

This scripts generates two dummy data files to be used for lfs-course-eval.

1) enrollment.csv - this file contains the enrollment data for each course
2) rawDataAll.csv - this file contains the data of all the evaluations for each course

The CSV file is created in lfs-fake-course-eval-data/output and should be moved to lfs-course-eval-server/src/scripts/source.

Run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`
